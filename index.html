      <h1>Netiquette</h1>
      <p>Hi there,</p>
      <p>Welcome to our Facebook page where we post exciting news about Bitwala, our services, upcoming new features and promotions as we bring you the future of money transfers.
      We also encourage you to share your experiences with our team and the rest of our users.</p>

      <p>This is our Facebook page netiquette. The following netiquette acts as a guideline in how we want to communicate with each other. Please take the time to review our guidelines and consider these prior to participating in a conversation.</p>

      <p><b>Have a constructive manner!</b> You are welcome to share ideas and feedback, but please be constructive while doing so. Ideas and suggestions are more helpful and valuable compared to an angry public rant.</p>

      <p><b>Respect is key! </b>Everyone has the right to their own opinion. We do not tolerate attacks just based on difference in personal views. We want to provide an open and constructive environment for our users. Thus, we reserve the right to delete any post or comments we feel that they include any of the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bullying, threats, harassment and hate speech of any kind</li>
        <li>Posts and/or comments expressing attitudes/views which are misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, or which discriminate against other communities, individuals or minorities</li>
        <li>Posts and/or comments expressing attitudes/views which are approving, initiating, promoting of violence</li>
        <li>Any kind of NSFW content</li>
        <li>Violation of copyright, corporate law, data protection and intellectual property</li>
        <li>Any advertising, promotions or offering of goods and services that we feel constitutes as spam.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please do note that our Facebook page does not act as an additional customer support channel. Never share your card details, password, user email and PIN with us on social channels. Therefore, we ask you to contact our customer support team directly for issues such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pending transactions, incl. Bank transfers, prepaid card top ups, or wallet transactions</li>
        <li>Card shipment tracking</li>
        <li>Change of personal data (address, shipping address, phone numbers, primary account email, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As mentioned above, this Facebook page is not a customer support channel. Thus, it is not monitored 24/7. Please expect a delay in our response, which normally should not be more than a couple of hours. For emergencies, please contact our support team directly.</p>

      <p>With our netiquette in mind, come and engage with us and fellow Bitwala users on our Facebook page.</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
      <p>Bitwala Team</p>
